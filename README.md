# GIT TRAINING

# General Task:

Add your name and email to AUTHORS.txt

Your work will depend on your card selected

## Fork or not?
* If your card is RED you must FORK the project.
* If your card is Black you must create a Branch inside of the project and work from there.

# Your Task:

Work in a branch with your name

* If your card is ODD: https://edabit.com/challenge/xfRucdwGksiyjZq4K
* If your card is Even: https://edabit.com/challenge/7KX5NogxnTzrKEd5P
* If your card is not a number you can pick any challenge from https://edabit.com/challenges/csharp

You must add a project with your name to the current solution with your code for the respective challenge (only cli).

The process to merge to Master must be using a Pull Request.

# Common work

Everyone must work in the original 

* If in your card the symbol is a Heart, Replace the text "Hello World" for something AMAZING.... (Creativity will be considered a plus)
* If in your card the symbol is a Spade, Avoid the windows close automatically.
* If in your card the symbol is a Clubs, Request the name of the user, and show before display the previous message.
* If in your card the symbol is a Diamond, Coordinate with the rest of Diamonds, and create tags in each merge from the previous
task, some via CLI and some via Stash.

Describe what do you did during the training in the CHANGELOG

Note: Remember files which were machine generated never should be committed.

Tip:

* Download a Pull Requets to local: `git fetch origin pull/<PR NUMBER>/head:<NEW NAME>`
* Untrack files 
```
git rm --cached `git ls-files -i --exclude-from=.gitignore`
```

At the end of the training EVERYONE must have a full repository with all the changes in their local envs.
